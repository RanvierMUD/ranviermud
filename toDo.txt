QUESTIONS:
Is it possible to use a script more than once (for example, have all weapons use the same script for wielding, have all armors use the same script?)

What even is l10n?
----Language localization.

What even is .yml?
Not a markup language, but a data language with outline formatting.


BACKLOG:

Create a trello board for all of this.

Make it so there is a separate mob name for bark messages (short and no caps) and for the room description/list (capitalized)

Add more classes, skills items, mobs.

Add attributes related to items, armor, attack damage, to-hit probability.

Add aliases for commands.

Add aggressiveness to mobs (if similar or nearby mobs are attacked, on seeing player, etc.)

Add conversation scripts for mobs.

Add shopkeeping scripts for mobs.

Add class- or stat- or skill- restrictions for items.

Add stats.

Look at how combat/leveling works and consider changing it.

Come up with a good setting (steampunk? anachronistic fantasy/sci-fi?)
