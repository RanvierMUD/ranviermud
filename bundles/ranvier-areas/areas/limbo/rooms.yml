    A completely black room. Somehow all of the light that should be coming from the room to the west does not pass
    through the archway. A single lightbulb hangs from the ceiling illuminating a small area. To the east you see a
    large white dome. There is a sign above the entrance to the dome: "Training Area"

    The entire area is covered by a large dome with a hexagonal grid surface. A beautiful blue sky reaches from horizon
    to horizon, punctuated by the lines of the grid. The dome shimmers as virtual birds fly into and out of its surface.
    The pure green grass is eerily undisturbed by you walking over it or by the simulated breeze.

    The dome in this section is bright red, the pure green grass is replaced with a smooth white surface. The ground
    beneath your feet has the word "Danger" in bright red letters tiled across the area.
