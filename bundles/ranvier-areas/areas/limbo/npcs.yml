    The training dummy is almost human shaped although slightly out of proportion. The material it's made of is hard to
    discern; it seems to constantly change between metal, wood, cloth, and glass depending on the angle. There is a
    large red and white bullseye painted on its chest. The dummy has no eyes and mindlessly meanders about the area.

    This dummy is significantly larger than the others. Bright red with a monstrous figure it lumbers around the area
    with a great echoing stomp. Where the other target dummies have a bullseye this dummy has a yellow exclamation mark.
