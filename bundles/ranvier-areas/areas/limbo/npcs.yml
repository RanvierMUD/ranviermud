    The training dummy is almost human shaped although slightly out of proportion. The material it's made of is hard to
    discern; it seems to constantly change between metal, wood, cloth, and glass depending on the angle. There is a
    large red and white bullseye painted on its chest. The dummy has no eyes and mindlessly meanders about the area.

  description: >-
    This dummy is significantly larger than the others. Bright red with a monstrous figure it lumbers around the area
    with a great echoing stomp. Where the other target dummies have a bullseye this dummy has a yellow exclamation mark.
