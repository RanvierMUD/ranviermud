    A rat's squeaks seem to indicate it wants some cheese. You check around the area, maybe someone has left some lying around.
    
    Once you find some bring it back to the rat, use '<white>quest log</white>' to find the quest number, then complete the quest with '<white>quest complete #</white>'

    A voice whispers to you: It would be wise to practice protecting yourself. There are a number of training dummies in this area that, while not pushovers, will not be too difficult.
    - Use '<white>attack dummy</white>' to start combat against the training dummy
    - Once it's dead any loot it drops will be in its corpse on the ground. You can use '<white>look in corpse</white>' to check again or '<white>loot corpse</white>' to retrieve all your loot.
  completionMessage: |-
    <b><cyan>Hint: You can get the loot from enemies with '<white>get <item> corpse</white>' but be quick about it, the corpse will decay after some time.</cyan>
