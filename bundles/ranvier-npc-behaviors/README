This bundle is a set of useful NPC behaviors.

For the `ranvier-sentient` behavior to work you will need an account with
api.ai and you will need to put your developer key in a file called `APIAIKEY`
in the same directory as this README file.

The behavior as-implemented is based off the agent provided in the `resources/`
directory of this bundle (`Ranvier-agent.zip`.) See the api.ai documentation on
how to import an agent.
