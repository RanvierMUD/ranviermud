# RanvierMUD
NodeJS based MUD engine with full localization support

## Development notes
Included in this master branch is a stable version of [ranvier-gen](), in the plugins directory, for generating areas from the command line.

See the [gamedev](https://github.com/seanohue/ranviermud/tree/gamedev) branch for a more developed world. The master branch will remain the 'lightweight' MUD framework branch and only common features will be backported to master.

## Features
* Full localization for any strings displayed to the player after they log in. This isn't a common feature in MUDs so I'll explain it. Player A and Player B log in, play the same game and see a different language. Same items, npcs, rooms, etc, different language.
* Scripting support: It's in Javascript! No need for a shitty DSL. The codebase is javascript, the scripting is javascript.
* Scripting is event-based. Put a listener in the script attached to your mob and it'll automagically happen when the event is emitted. Adding new events is easy as npc.emit('eventName');
* Pfile saving in JSON, easy to parse for external usage
* Rooms, items, and npcs are easily described in yaml. No weird bullshit ~~~~ and byte-specific parsing that requires a GUI editor to build.
* Arbitrary room exits custom to each room not locked into n/s/e/w and it's not a pain in the ass to add them
* Did I mention it's in blasting Javascript? No compiling, no C, no cygwin, no 15 year old spaghetti code.
* Basic leveling system
* Basic combat sytem. Due to the way the repl works it could be used to do turn-based or real-time combat without changing the base functionality.
* Basic, easily customizable/overhauled skill system
* Basic channel system

## Requirements

* NodeJS >= 0.6.2
