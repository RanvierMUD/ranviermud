# RanvierMUD
NodeJS based MUD engine with full localization support

## Development notes
Included in this master branch is a stable version of [ranvier-gen](), in the plugins directory, for generating areas from the command line. (currently pretty buggy, I am planning on rewriting it soon)

See the [gamedev](https://github.com/seanohue/ranviermud/tree/gamedev) branch for the latest features. The master branch will be the latest 'stable' release. The 'development' branch is the lightweight MUD engine branch for submitting PRs upstream.

## Features
* Full localization (to be deprecated, without special characters it is not very useful right now.)
* Scripting support: It's in Javascript! No need for a shitty DSL. The codebase is javascript, the scripting is javascript.
* Scripting is event-based. Put a listener in the script attached to your mob and it'll automagically happen when the event is emitted. Adding new events is easy as npc.emit('eventName'); See documentation on node event emitters for more.
* Pfile saving in JSON, easy to parse for external usage.
* Rooms, items, and npcs are easily described in yaml. No weird bullshit ~~~~ and byte-specific parsing that requires a GUI editor to build.
* Arbitrary room exits custom to each room not locked into n/s/e/w and it's not a pain in the ass to add them
* Did I mention it's in blasting Javascript? No compiling, no C, no cygwin, no 15 year old spaghetti code.
* Leveling, passive/active trainable skills, passive/active feats/talents/spells/what-have-you.
* Turn-based PvE combat featuring different stances and a targeting system.
* Basic channel system

## Requirements

* NodeJS >= v5.6.0

## Documentation
Holy crap there is actually documentation and guides for this thing!

## TODO:
* See todos.md
