Channels are any mode of communication between players in the game. This guide will go over creating 4 different
channels with different audiences as an example of how you may want to implement your own: say, yell, tell, and chat.

[TOC]

## channels.js

The first step to adding channels is to create the `channels.js` file in your bundle.

```
bundles/my-bundle/
  channels.js
```

Almost identical to all other bundle loaded `.js` files, channels.js instead returns an array of channels. The examples
below show only one channel per file but you can absolutely have multiple channels, hence returning an array.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (srcPath) => {
  const Channel = require(srcPath + 'Channel');

  return [
  ];
};
```

## Example channels

### chat

This `chat` channel is an example of a game-wide communication channel. All players in the game see it.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (srcPath) => {
  const Channel = require(srcPath + 'Channel');
  const AudienceWorld = require(srcPath + 'ChannelAudience/World');
  const PlayerRoles = require(srcPath + 'PlayerRoles');

  return [
    new Channel({
      // the name of the channel is the command the player will use
      name: 'chat',

      // Information about this channel shown when player types channel name without a message
      description: 'Chat with everyone on the game',

      /*
      optional color of output from his channel.
      Available colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
      Additionally you can specify 'bold' as a color to make the text bold. e.g., color: ['bold', 'red'],
      */
      color: ['bold', 'green'],

      /*
      `audience` defines who will receive the message from this channel.
      Available audiences can be seen in: `src/ChannelAudience/`
      */
      audience: new AudienceWorld(),

      /*
      Optionally you can specify a minimum player role required to use the channel
      Note: This property is not used by the core to perform any restrictions, it is simply added as a
      public property to allow bundles to access it and do their own restriction.

      minRequiredRole: PlayerRoles.ADMIN,
      */
    }),
  ];
};
```

### say

`say` is a common MUD channel which communicates a message to other players in the same room as the player.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (srcPath) => {
  const Channel = require(srcPath + 'Channel');
  const AudienceRoom = require(srcPath + 'ChannelAudience/Room');

  return [
    new Channel({
      name: 'say',
      color: ['cyan'],
      description: 'Send a message to all players in your room',
      audience: new AudienceRoom(),

      /*
      formatter allows you to customize how message from this channel appear to the sender and receiver
      `sender` defines how the message appears the sender, and vice versa for target.
      Both functions get the `Player` who sent it, the `Player` receiving the message, the message itself
      and the `colorify` function to apply the channel's color to the message.
      */
      formatter: {
        sender: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`You say, '${message}'`);
        },

        target: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`${sender.name} says, '${message}'`);
        }
      }
    }),
  ];
};
```

### tell

`tell` is an example of a private channel. The message is only shown to the sender and target.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (srcPath) => {
  const Channel = require(srcPath + 'Channel');
  const AudiencePrivate = require(srcPath + 'ChannelAudience/Private');

  return [
    new Channel({
      name: 'tell',
      color: ['bold', 'cyan'],
      description: 'Send a private message to another player',
      audience: new AudiencePrivate(),
      formatter: {
        sender: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`You tell ${target.name}, '${message}'`);
        },

        target: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`${sender.name} tells you, '${message}'`);
        }
      }
    }),
  ];
};
```

### yell

`yell` is an example channel that sends a message only to players in the same area as the sender.

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (srcPath) => {
  const Channel = require(srcPath + 'Channel');
  const AudienceArea = require(srcPath + 'ChannelAudience/Area');

  return [
    new Channel({
      name: 'yell',
      color: ['bold', 'red'],
      description: 'Send a message to everyone in your area',
      audience: new AudienceArea(),
      formatter: {
        sender: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`You yell, '${message}'`);
        },

        target: function (sender, target, message, colorify) {
          return colorify(`Someone yells from nearby, '${message}'`);
        }
      }
    }),
  ];
};
```
