In Ranvier all NPCs for an area are defined in a single file within the area folder: `npcs.yml`

Here we have two NPCs. The rat can enter combat, has a custom script, a default inventory, hands out a quest and has
some extra attributes. The old man is the most basic NPC you can have.

## Definition Fields

`field` _`type`_ `(default)`

----

`id` _`number`_
:    ***required*** NPC id, unique among the NPCs of the current area

`name` _`string`_
:    ***required*** String displayed when the player sees the NPC in the room

`keywords` _`string`_
:    ***required*** Keywords that the player can use to target this NPC, keywords do not need to be unique

`description` _`string`_
:    ***required*** String displayed when the player looks directly at the NPC

`script` _`string`_
:    Name of custom script to attach to this NPC (See [Scripting](scripting.md))

`behaviors` _`Object<string,Object>`_
:    List of behaviors to attach to this NPC. The key is the behavior name, the value is the configuration object for that
behavior. For boolean (on/off) behaviors, `true` suffices for the config. (See [Scripting](scripting.md) for creating behaviors)

`attributes` _`object`_
:    Arbitrary list of attributes to attach to this NPC. Unlike items, these attributes will be turned into an AttributesMap (see `src/Attributes` and `src/Character`, so these are not arbitrary.

`items` _`array<EntityReference>`_
:    List of Entity References representing the NPC's default inventory

`quests` _`array<EntityReference>`_
:    List of Entity References representing the quests that this character gives out (See [Quests](quests.md))
