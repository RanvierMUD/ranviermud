Item, NPC, and Room scripting comes in the form of event-based scripting. See the [Event](../events/) section for a general overview
of how Ranvier eventing works before reading on.

[TOC]

## Creating a script

Scripts are defined for an area in the `scripts/` folder underneath the area's folder. For each entity type there is a
subfolder. For example:

```
bundles/my-area/areas/limbo/
  scripts/
    npcs/
      1-rat.js
    items/
      1-shiv.js
    rooms/
      1-test.js
```

As a matter of convention scripts are named, `<entity id>-<whatever you want>`. It's not _required_ but it will help a
lot when trying to figure out what script goes to what entity.

See the relevant entity's guide section on how to add the script to the entity.

## Behaviors

Behaviors are scripts that you can reuse for the same entity types across multiple areas/bundles. For example, maybe you
want to have many different NPCs wander around at random, or immediately attack players upon entering the room; you can
use behaviors to re-use the same script.

Behaviors are defined similarly to normal scripts, and also rely on events, but are created inside the `behaviors/` directory inside your
bundle, which is _outside_ of your `areas/` directory. Another key difference is that they are configurable in the entity's .yaml definition (see each entity type's documentation for some examples, and below for details on configuration).

```
bundles/my-bundle/
  areas/
    limbo/
    ...
  behaviors/
    npcs/
      aggro.js
    items/
    rooms/
```

Again, see the relevant entity type's scripting guide section below for more on how to add behaviors to that entity.

> Tip: Behaviors can be used as flags. For example, if you say `behaviors: ['combat']` on an NPC, you don't need to
> actually create a combat.js behavior file, `npc.hasBehavior('combat')` will still return true. This is used, as an
> example, in the `kill` command in `ranvier-combat` to differentiate pacifist NPCs from NPCs that can enter combat.

## File Structure

Entity-specific scripts and Behavior script files follow the same file structure outlined here:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = srcPath => {
  return {
    /*
    The familiar bundle script file format we've seen in commands and quests returns here.
    To listen for an event, simply add a new key (which is the event name) to 'listeners'. The value for each listener is a closure accepting GameState (seen here as state, see the Ranvier server executable for more) and returning a function
    whose arguments are dependent on the event. See the Default Events section below for
    to see some examples of arguments being passed to the listeners.
    */
    listeners: {
      someEvent: state => (/* event args */) => {
        // do stuff here
      }
    }
  };
};
```

**NOTE**: Behaviors are written differently because the first argument to their listener is
_always_ `config`, an object that will be equal to the behavior config as defined in that
entity's yml file. As an example, the following is what an item with a 'test' behavior
that listens for the 'foo' event would look like:

In items.yml:
```yaml
- id: 9
  name: 'My Item'
  behaviors:
    test:
      hello: "World"
```

When event is fired:
```javascript
// the config is automatically prepended to the arguments, you DO NOT have to manually
// send it in when emitting events
myItem.emit('foo', player, 'baz');
```

In your behavior listeners:
```javascript
listeners: {
  foo: state => (config, player, thing) => {
    console.log(config);
    /*
    This will output as per the 'test' behaviors config in items.yml
    {
      hello: "World"
    }
    */
    console.log(player, thing); /* Player, 'baz' */
  }
}
```

## Default events

This is a list of events that are emitted by default in Ranvier, from one of two sources:

***Engine*** - Events that come from the engine itself (from `src/`) and will _always_ be available.

***Default Bundles*** - Events that come from one of the `ranvier-*` bundles and may not be available if you have disabled them.

Events are shown as:
`eventName` _`(ArgumentType arguments)`_
:    Details of event

### NPCs

#### Engine

`combatEnd`
:    Combat has ended, emitted when an NPC's list of combatants becomes empty

`combatStart` _`(Character target)`_
:    Combat has started against `target`, emitted when NPC was not in combat and now is. Event is _not_ fired if the NPC
was already in combat when new combatants are added

`damaged` _`(Damage damage)`_
:    Something has decreased one of the NPC's attributes. This emits when any attribute is damaged, not just health. See `src/Damage.js`
for details of information available from `damage` argument.

`healed` _`(Heal heal)`_
:    Same as `damaged` but increased attribute instead of decreased.

`hit` _`(Damage damage, Character target)`_
:    This NPC caused damage to the target. Target may be itself.

`heal` _`(Heal heal, Character target)`_
:    Same as `hit` but increased attribute instead of decreased.

`spawn`
:    NPC is initially created; this event emits immediately after NPC is placed in its target room.

`updateTick`
:    This event is special in that it automatically fires every tenth of a second on Rooms, Items, NPCs, and Players.
This event should be used for any event that is based on time, e.g., NPC should wander around every N seconds.

#### Core Bundles

`deathblow` _`(Character target)`_
:    NPC just killed `target`.

`killed`
:    NPC died.

`playerDropItem` _`(Player player, Item item)`_
:    `player` just dropped `item` in the room with the NPC.

`playerEnter` _`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just entered the room with the NPC.

`playerLeave`_`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just left the room. **NOTE**: `playerLeave` is actually fired _before_ the player is removed from the room.

### Items

#### Engine

`updateTick`
:    See `updateTick` under NPCs.

#### Core Bundles

`drop` _`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just dropped this item.

`equip` _`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just equipped this item.

`get` _`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just picked up this item.

`put` _`(Player player, Item container)`_
:    `player` just put this item into `container`.

### Rooms

#### Engine

`updateTick`
:    See `updateTick` for NPCs.

#### Core Bundles

`playerEnter` _`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just entered this room.

`playerLeave`_`(Player player)`_
:    `player` just left this room. **NOTE**: `playerLeave` is actually fired _before_ the player is removed from the room.
