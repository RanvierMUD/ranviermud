## Definition Fields

`field` _`type`_ `(default)`

----

`id` _`number`_
:    ***required*** Item id unique among the items of the current area

`type` _`ItemType`_ `(OBJECT)`
:    See `src/ItemType.js`. Natively, does not change _functionality_, simply a helpful flag for you to use in scripts to
detect the item type

`name` _`string`_
:    ***required*** String seen while in the player's inventory or equipment list, or in a container

`roomDesc` _`string`_
:    ***required*** String displayed when the item is seen on the ground in a room

`keywords` _`string`_
:    ***required*** Keywords that the player can use to target this item; keywords do not need to be unique on a per-item basis

`description` _`string`_
:    String displayed when the player looks directly at the item

`script` _`string`_
:    Name of custom script to attach to this item (See [Scripting](scripting.md))

`behaviors` _`Object<string,Object>`_
:    List of behaviors to attach to this item. The key is the behavior name, the value is the configuration object for that
behavior. For boolean (on/off) behaviors, `true` suffices for the config. (See [Scripting](scripting.md) for more on creating behaviors)

`slot` _`string`_
:    If the item can be equipped, `slot` identifies the `wear` location of the item. This can be an arbitrary string but
you probably want to limit equipment to a standard list of locations

`attributes` _`object`_
:    Arbitrary list of attributes to attach to this object. There are no constraints on this so you are free to assign
basically anything here that you want to look for inside commands/scripts/etc. Accessible in scripts via the `item.attributes` property

`items` _`array<EntityReference>`_
:    For containers. A list of Entity References identifying which items should be loaded into this item's inventory
