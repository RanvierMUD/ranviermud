Effects temporarily or permanently change attributes of their target. For example:

* shielding them from harm
* regenerating or damaging their health over time
* increasing a stat such as strength

to name a few simple cases.

However, effects in Ranvier are not simple buffs and debuffs; they receive all of the events the target receives.

A few examples of how effects can be combined with other aspects of Ranvier's engine with interesting results:

* A trapped chest that shoots a poison needle into the player character when opened, dealing 'poison' damage over time unless the player drinks an antidote.
* A weapon that causes the player to be healed for a percentage of damage dealt to foes.
* A multiplier to experience points when grouped with other players.
* Boots that make a warrior's Kick skill do 20% more damage.
* A silence effect, preventing the player from using certain channels or casting certain spells.
* Cause the player character to dream while sleeping.
