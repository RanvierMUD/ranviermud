Effects can be used to modify a target in some way, temporary or permanent. For example:

* shielding them from harm
* regenerating or damaging their health over time
* increasing a stat such as strength

to name a few simple cases.

However, effects in Ranvier are not simple buffs and debuffs; they receive all of the events the target receives.

A few examples of how effects can be combined with other aspects of Ranvier's engine with interesting results:

* A trapped chest that shoots a poison needle into the player character when opened, dealing 'poison' damage over time unless the player drinks an antidote.
* A weapon that causes the player to be healed for a percentage of damage dealt to foes.
* A multiplier to experience points when grouped with other players.
* Boots that make a warrior's Kick skill do 20% more damage.
* A silence effect, preventing the player from using certain channels or casting certain spells.
* Cause the player character to have prophetic dreams while sleeping.
* A confusion spell causing a character to `say` gibberish every 30 seconds and `move` in random directions.

You can be creative when using effects, since they are as fully scriptable as commands or events. In fact, as mentioned above, you have access to all player commands and events via the effects system.
