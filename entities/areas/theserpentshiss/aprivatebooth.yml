    en: 'Hidden from the rest of the taproom, this booth features benches of oak and inlaid mahogany in diamond patterns, circling a glass table. Figures of a nude man and woman intertwined with serpents has been frosted into the surface of the table. Cracks radiate through the design, as if someone slammed a fist or tankard into the middle of the table. The torn-up heavy royal crimson curtains lead out in to the taproom proper.'
