    en: "Above your head are the thick wooden joists supporting the taproom's floor. A chandelier hangs from them, covered in small glowing orbs that fill the room with a deep orange light. Red rugs are strewn haphazardly, as are half-broken card tables and a roulette wheel that has been knocked half off of its table. To the east is the reception area. To the north is a private room with a painting of a cobra and a python locked in mortal battle on its doors."
