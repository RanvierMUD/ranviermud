  description:
    en: "Above your head are the supporting beams of the taproom's floor. Red rugs are strewn haphazardly, as are half-broken card tables and a roulette wheel that has been knocked half off of its table. To the east is the reception area. To the north is a private room with a painting of a cobra and a python locked in mortal battle on its doors. The northeast corner of this room is taken up by a small bar stocked with bottles of various-colored liquids with images of serpents emblazoned on their labels."
