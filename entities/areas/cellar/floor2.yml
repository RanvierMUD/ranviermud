  description: "In the floor is an open trapdoor with a ladder leading down into the dark subbasement. A mildewy smell wafts upwards. Around you are rows and rows of shelves containing mostly broken bottles. The creaking wooden floor is littered with broken glass and splintered wood. Light filters in through small, high, slitted windows that afford no real view of the outside world."
