 location: 2
 description: "You are stuffed between barrels of some fermenting substance and boxes of long-since-rotten foods and linens. At the southwestern end of this de-facto passageway is a dark, mildewy alcove, while light pours in from above a rickety ladder at the other end of the passageway to the northeast. \n Rodents scamper between your feet."
